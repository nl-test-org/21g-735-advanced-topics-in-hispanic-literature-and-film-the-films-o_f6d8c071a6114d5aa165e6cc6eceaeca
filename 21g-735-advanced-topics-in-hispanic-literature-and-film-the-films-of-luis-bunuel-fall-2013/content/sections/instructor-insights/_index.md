Course Overview
---------------

This page focuses on the course _21G.735 Advanced Topics in Hispanic Literature and Film: The Films of Luis Buñuel_ as it was taught by Prof. Elizabeth Garrels from 1999-2013.

This course explored films spanning the entire career of pioneering Spanish filmmaker Luis Buñuel (1900-1983). The class materials paid special attention to his Mexican period, in exile, and the films he made in, and about, Spain. The course focused on historical contexts and relevant film criticism.

This course was taught at MIT seven times between 1999 and 2013. Instead of representing a single semester of a course, as is typical on OpenCourseWare, 21G.735 represents a history of the course, and a compilation of all the materials used to teach it, during this period of time.
