_In this section, Prof. Garrels shares her insights about using fotogramas as study tools._

{{< quote "Fotogramas, or still images from the films, were very important study tools in the course." "â€” Elizabeth Garrels" >}}

Although not available on the OCW course because of copyright constraints, _fotogramas_, or still images from the films, were very important study tools in the course. Students used them to review specific scenes in the film without having to review the entire film. They used them as memory prompts to reconstruct the action going on at the moment the _fotogram_ was taken. They also used them to study frame composition, and they included them in their papers in order to illustrate their points. In class, I used stills for similar purposes. They saved time because they were infinitely easier to flash up on a screen than portions of the film itself.
