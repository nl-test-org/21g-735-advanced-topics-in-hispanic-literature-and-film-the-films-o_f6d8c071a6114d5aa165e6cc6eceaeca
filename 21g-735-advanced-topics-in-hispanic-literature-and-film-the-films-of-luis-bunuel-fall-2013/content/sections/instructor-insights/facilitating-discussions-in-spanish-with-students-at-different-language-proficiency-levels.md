{{< quote "Each group was constructed according to the language level of its participants. Sometimes, native speakers would be included in each group along with non-native speakers, so that the native speakers could function as language models." "— Elizabeth Garrels" >}}

_In this section, Prof. Garrels discusses how she facilitated discussions about films in Spanish with students at different language proficiency levels. She notes that film-specifc questions and different grouping strategies supported students’ language development and_ _comprehension._

Film Questions
--------------

The course was open to both native and non-native Spanish speakers. Prior to our discussions about the films, I produced a number of film-specific questions. Students were required to study the questions after seeing the film for the first time, to bring them to class, and to be prepared to discuss them in an informed and thoughtful manner.

Small Group Discussions
-----------------------

Class discussions were often conducted in small groups. Each group was constructed according to the language level of its participants. Sometimes, native speakers would be included in each group along with non-native speakers, so that the native speakers could function as language models. On other occasions, students would be grouped according to their fluency, so that native and advanced non-natives could speak as quickly as they wished, allowing slower non-native speakers to communicate at a speed comfortable for them.
